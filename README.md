# Airbnb Data Analysis (Python)

This project uses Python to analyse Airbnb listing and review data to understand pricing patterns, availability, and key factors influencing listings. The analysis focuses on cleaning raw data, exploring trends, and extracting insights to support data-driven decision making.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to apply Python-based data analysis techniques to a real-world dataset. The work demonstrates how structured data can be cleaned, explored, and analysed to uncover meaningful patterns and business insights.

## What I Did
- Loaded and prepared the Airbnb dataset using Python
- Cleaned and standardised data to improve reliability
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and outliers
- Analysed key variables such as price, availability, and listing characteristics
- Created visualisations to support interpretation of results
- Summarised findings in a clear, structured report

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical reasoning
- Data visualisation
- Translating analysis into written insights

## Files
-  Full analysis report including methodology, visualisations, and findings

This project demonstrates my ability to use Python for practical data analysis and to communicate insights clearly through structured reporting.
